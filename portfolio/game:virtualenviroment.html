<p>A cultural significance I chose to build is an iconic Disney bear, Winnie the Pooh. I decided to do Winnie the Pooh because he is my favorite character, as well as my childhood growing up. I feel like Winnie the Pooh has a lot of cultural significance because each character represents a mental disorder. Winnie the Pooh has an eating disorder, Piglet has an anxiety disorder, and Tigger has attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). There are many more mental issues represented in Winnie the Pooh. Mental health is so important and many people should not be afraid to ask for help when need to tell that they have one. Not everyone is perfect.</p>
