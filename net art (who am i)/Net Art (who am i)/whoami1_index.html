<h1 style="text-align:center;">Who am I?</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;">"You are an extrovert who enjoys trying new things and always somehow got yourself in trouble in high school."</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">"You are social, energetic, and maybe have ADHD from how unorganized your folder looks."</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">"Many might think you have a bad reputation when that is not the case."</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">"But that's ok."</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">"Not everyone is expecting to be perfect and it is ok to not always be an extrovert."</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">"Sometimes you just need a little help."</p>
